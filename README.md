Hi! I'm SalmonPest, and i am a devoloper! Nowadays i mostly program Golang and C, but i dabble in TypeScript sometimes! I also know HTML and CSS, but those aren't real programming languages.

- Code editor:           Neovim,
- Favourite language:    C or Go depending on my mood,
- Favourite game engine: Godot,

I also do gamedev sometimes? I like Godot, it's open source and intuitive, but i'm not incredible at it, i'm actually kinda bad at it, but i do it anyway! So yeah, i'm not incredible at anything really, but i get things done! So, yeah, that's it!
