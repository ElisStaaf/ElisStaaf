  Hello! My name is Elis (though I go by "Salmon" on the great international net)
  and I am a programmer! I mostly program C and C++, but I've dabbled in Assembly, 
  Python and many more programming languages! I put most of my code on github
  because I have a fear of losing it somewhere in the abyss of my scripts
  folder. Feel free to contribute on any of my projects, all
  contributions (except for those that break the project ofc)
  are welcome! Oh, and I use Neovim btw! When I'm not coding, I
  enjoy indulging in "intellectual" studies such as politics and
  -- sometimes -- philosophy. I also enjoy reading.
